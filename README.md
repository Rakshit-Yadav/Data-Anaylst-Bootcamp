# Data Analyst Bootcamp Notes

## Overview

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and resources as I progress through the **Data Analyst Bootcamp** by [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF). I am using **Obsidian** for structured note-taking and **GitHub** for version control and tracking my learning journey.

## Structure
This is the initial structure that I have planned for each sub-folder of the tool I start learning. It is not fixed and may get changed as I progress
The repository is organised as follows:

- **Notes/** - Structured notes covering key concepts from each module. Notes will be a .md file as I am working in Obsidian but also sometimes in Neovim.
    
- **Files/** - Hands-on exercises and code snippets. Basically all of the respective files and code will be stored here.
    
- **Attachments/** - Media files used in my notes (images, diagrams, etc.). This folder will be a reoccuring folder within each folder. I have done this so that  it is personally easy for me to yank(nvim reference ( Í¡Â° Ù„Íœ Í¡Â°)) particular media for the notes in that specific folder. 
    
- **Resources/** - Additional references and links for deeper learning. I don't have anything personally ready for this folder but going to put this here in order to potentially make a separate note file in the end to reference things that I used throughout, I may just do that naturally in the notes only, will see.
    

## Tools Used

- **Obsidian** - For managing and structuring my learning notes. I highly suggest to check out [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) community plug-in by Vinzent03. It is a great plug-in to directly commit and sync changes of your vault folder to Github. A blog to get you started which also helped me is [this one](https://linked-blog-starter.vercel.app/connect-obsidian-vault-with-github). For which the author also made a [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YZz38U20ws).
    
- **GitHub** - For version control and tracking progress.
    
- **Tools to Learn** (List will get updated as I move forward in the bootcamp)
	- SQL
    

## Progress Tracking

I will be updating this repository regularly as I go through the bootcamp. Feel free to explore and follow along!
